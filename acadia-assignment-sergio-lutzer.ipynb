Introduction\n","\n","Hello, fellow Acadia Assignment recruters! Our mission is to uncover insights and trends from a dataset provided by a US-based Toy Retailer. We’ll be comparing two years of data (2022 vs 2023) across various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and customer categories.\n","\n","Our analysis will be guided by the following objectives:\n","\n","1. **KPI Overview**: We’ll compare the performance of 2022 vs 2023 for both overall customers and new customers.\n","2. **Store Performance**: We’ll identify the top 2 and bottom 2 stores by 2023 vs 2022 growth and pinpoint the core KPI which saw the most growth.\n","3. **Profile Performance**: We’ll compare profile performance for the two timeframes and highlight the best and worst-performing profiles.\n","4. **Channel Comparison**: We’ll compare KPIs for customers who shopped only online, only in-store, and through multiple channels (multichannel) in 2023.\n","5. **Second Purchase Analysis**: For all the customers who made more than one purchase in 2023, we’ll calculate their average order value for their second transaction.\n","\n","We’ll be using SQL to wrangle the data and Python to analyze it. The results will be presented in a clean, well-formatted Excel sheet that’s easy to understand. We’ll also call out any interesting insights and data anomalies we come across.\n","\n","## 1.1. Limitations\n","This analysis will only consider:\n","- Stores that have served an equal number of days in both time periods (2022 & 2023)\n","- Customers for which we have a profile available\n","- Those customers residing within 50 miles of the store they shopped in."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"71f2c1f1","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.011518,"end_time":"2024-04-26T19:28:01.828982","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-04-26T19:28:01.817464","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# 2.

Final Insights\n","In conclusion, our analysis of the US-based Toy Retailer’s data from 2022 and 2023 has provided valuable insights across various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and customer categories.\n","\n","We observed that the **performance** varied significantly across different stores and customer profiles. Some stores and profiles performed exceptionally well, while others showed room for improvement. This highlights the importance of personalized strategies tailored to specific stores and customer segments.\n","\n","Our **channel comparison** revealed that customers who shopped exclusively in-store tended to buy more items and spend more money per transaction. This suggests potential opportunities to enhance the online shopping experience and encourage multichannel shopping.\n","\n","The **second purchase** analysis showed that customers tend to spend less in their subsequent transactions. This insight could guide strategies to encourage customers to spend more in their later transactions.\n","\n","Overall, this analysis underscores the power of data in uncovering insights and informing strategic decisions. It’s clear that understanding customer behavior and performance trends can play a crucial role in a company’s success.\n","\n","Thank you for the opportunity to conduct this analysis.
